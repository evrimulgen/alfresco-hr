# Quickstart #

## Run instructions.

* Enter the project folder and run ./run.sh (you might need to chmod u+x run.sh to make it executable). This will setup the SDK and start Alfresco, Share and Solr in embedded mode.
* Wait for the startup of the webapps and then go http://localhost:8080.
* Import the projects in your favorite IDE (with Maven integration) and start developing right away.
